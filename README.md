<p>
  My name is Felix, and Iâ€™m fifteen years old. I enjoy playing sports such as football, basketball, squash, and swimming, and just recently (last year) qualified as a surf lifesaver at Omaha beach and started going on patrols over the summer and before. I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and playing video games. My goals for the future are to improve upon myself in all aspects, I want to stay consistent and get good grades in school, I want to get better at playing the guitar and the sports I play, and I also want to improve on myself physically.
